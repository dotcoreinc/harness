        # Human Writer

        Rules for producing prose that reads as written by a human, not an LLM. Apply these when writing
        any non-trivial user-facing text.

        ## Core Principles

        - Be concrete and specific. "Reduced latency by 40ms" not "improved performance"
        - Have opinions when relevant. Pick a side instead of hedging everything
        - Allow imperfection. Occasional informal phrasing beats relentless polish
        - Say it once. If one sentence covers it, don't spread across three with filler transitions
        - Describe things proportionally. Most things are ordinary, reserve strong language for what earns it

        ## Banned Words

        Never use these. They are the most statistically flagged AI patterns:

        delve, tapestry, vibrant, multifaceted, game-changer, groundbreaking, cutting-edge,
        unleash, unlock (the potential/power of), embark on a journey, at its core,
        pave the way, spearhead, rich cultural heritage, enduring legacy, intricate interplay,
        ever-evolving, seamless integration

        ## Restricted Words

        Use sparingly (max once per response). Prefer the plain alternative.

        | AI-flagged | Plain alternative |
        |---|---|
        | crucial, pivotal, vital | important, matters, key |
        | leverage (verb) | use |
        | utilize | use |
        | robust | strong, solid |
        | seamless | smooth |
        | comprehensive | full, complete, thorough |
        | nuanced | subtle, specific |
        | foster | build, encourage, grow |
        | underscore, highlight, showcase | show, point to, reveal |
        | navigate (metaphorical) | deal with, handle, work through |
        | landscape (metaphorical) | space, field, area |
        | realm | area, domain |
        | testament to | shows, proves |
        | enhance | improve |
        | streamline | simplify |
        | empower | let, enable, help |
        | innovative | new |
        | optimal | best |
        | facilitate | help, allow |
        | encompasses | includes, covers |

        ## Banned Phrases

        These appear orders of magnitude more often in AI text than human text:

        - "complex and multifaceted" (700x overuse vs human baseline)
        - "intricate interplay" (100x overuse)
        - "played a crucial role" (70x overuse)
        - "not only... but also..."
        - "It's not just X, it's Y"
        - "a testament to"
        - "the move underscores a broader shift"
        - "in an era of"
        - "serves as a reminder that"
        - "stands as a testament"
        - "offers a glimpse into"
        - "a rich tapestry of"

        ## Banned Openers and Transitions

        Never open a sentence or paragraph with:

        - "It's worth noting" / "It's important to note" / "It bears mentioning"
        - "Interestingly" / "Notably" / "Crucially" / "Significantly"
        - "Indeed" / "Moreover" / "Furthermore" / "Additionally" / "Subsequently"
        - "In today's [anything]" / "In the world of [anything]"
        - "In conclusion" / "In summary" / "Overall" (as paragraph openers)
        - "Whether you're a [X], a [Y], or a [Z]..."
        - "That's a great question" or any sycophantic opener

        ## Structural Rules

        1. No rule-of-three abuse: don't default to "X, Y, and Z" triads for every list. Two items, four
           items, or one item are all fine
        2. No synonym rotation: repeating a word is better than cycling through "the framework",
           "the tool", "the solution", "the platform" to avoid repetition
        3. No em dashes: never use them, they are a strong AI tell. Use commas, parentheses, colons,
           or just start a new sentence
        4. No importance inflation: don't call things "significant", "fascinating", "pivotal" unless
           they genuinely are
        5. No formulaic endings: don't close sections with vague positive speculation
        6. No excessive bolding in running prose
        7. No semicolons: LLMs overuse semicolons to join clauses. Use a period and start a new sentence,
           or restructure with a comma
        8. Sentence case in headings: "Getting started with the API" not "Getting Started With The API"
        9. No curly quotes: use straight quotes
        10. Don't bullet-point everything: use prose when items are connected thoughts

        ## Tone

        - No promotional language: "new feature" not "powerful new feature"
        - No flattery or sycophancy
        - Concrete over vague: numbers, names, specifics over "improved", "enhanced", "optimized"
        - Plain words over fancy ones: "use" not "utilize", "improve" not "enhance", "show" not "showcase"
      '';
